# PRISMO-trading-research-and-execution-system
Fully automated trading platform. Backtesting module created for efficient model testing and creation, execution system to trade the system live.


# Live Execution System 
Built oupon ib_insync (wrapper for interactive brokers API), allows multiple independent strategies to be run within a single TWS session.

# Backtesting System
Platform to backtest strategies, with two main components:
  - Optimizer
  - Bias removed backtest

The optimizer is the 'efficient' code, that finds optimum parameters for the strategies being researched. The bias removal backtester tries to remove as much: look-ahead, survivorship and sample size bias. This is achieved via a multitude of methods, including monte carlo simulation, real-time trading simulation and AI to parse data from multiple sources. The code implements multiprocessing. It outputs a range of heuristics for model evaluation. Below is a sample of results generated by the bias removal system.
